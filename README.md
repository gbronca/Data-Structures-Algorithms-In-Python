## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms. The implementations are meant to be educational, so they may be less efficient than the implementations in the Python standard library. Each data structure or algorithm is implemented in its own module, which contains a class with a corresponding name. The corresponding test cases are in the tests module.
